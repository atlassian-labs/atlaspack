# Repository information

- This is a repository on GitHub and GitHub actions are used to trigger builds.
- Github configuration is loaded in .github/.
- Validate that the builds will pass on CI before completing tasks, .github/workflows/ci.yml contains the configuration for most builds - run these first.

## Pull requests

- You can offer to write the pull request description using the template in .github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md. Do not delete headings or restructure the template.
- Keep in mind that we are in a public repository that non-Atlassian employees can access.
- Make sure you ask the developer before creating any pull requests and ensure they have reviewed the pull request description.
- Each PR should have a changeset, which can be generated by running `yarn changeset`. Documentation can be found at https://github.com/changesets/changesets/tree/main/docs and configuration is in .changeset/.
- You don't need a changeset if the change does not affect published packages.

## Git

- Do not push to the repository without confirmation from the developer.

# Welcome to your VS Code Extension

## Get up and running straight away

- Press `F5` to open a new window with your extension loaded.
- Set breakpoints in your code inside `src/extension.ts` to debug your extension.
- Find output from your extension in the debug console.
- Run Parcel in a project with `--reporter @parcel/reporter-lsp`

## Make changes

- You can relaunch the extension from the debug toolbar after changing code in `src/extension.ts`.
- You can also reload (`Ctrl+R` or `Cmd+R` on Mac) the VS Code window with your extension to load your changes.

## Explore the API
